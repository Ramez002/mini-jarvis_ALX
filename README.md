# Mini-Jarvis AI Assistant

A simplified AI assistant inspired by Jarvis, designed to brainstorm ideas, answer questions, and interact using text (and optionally voice). Built with Node.js, TypeScript, and AI tools like Google Gemini.

## Project Description

Mini-Jarvis is a personal AI assistant that can:
- Think logically and provide suggestions.
- Understand jokes and casual conversation.
- Help with planning or general queries.
- Optionally, accept voice input and respond.

This is a **simplified, experimental version** meant to explore AI-assisted workflows, not a full-fledged Jarvis.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** + **Bun** (runtime)
- **TypeScript** (main language)
- **Google Gemini API** (AI generation)
- **Optional:** Speech recognition / text-to-speech libraries
- **Optional:** n8n for automation flows

## AI Integration Strategy

- **Code / Feature Generation:** AI helps scaffold features, functions, and responses.
- **Conversation / Brainstorming:** AI generates ideas and provides reasoning.
- **Optional Voice Interaction:** AI can receive voice input and respond using TTS.
- **Optional Automation:** n8n workflows can handle external triggers or API calls.
